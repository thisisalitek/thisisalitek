## Probar Software & Barcode Systems

In February 2006, we established the Probar Software Company with 3 people. My other 2 partners had companies in the textile and construction sectors, they left the software business to me. The first year, I was the only one in the company.

We didn't have an office of our own. In the model shop department of the textile company belonging to my partners.

I started with 1 desk, 1 work chair, 1 phone and 1 desktop computer. I was handling all of the salesman, software development, project management, customer support jobs. At the end of the second year, one of my partners completely transferred to our company.

We had a total of 12 personnel as 4 software engineers, 2 accountants, 1 sales specialist, 5 customer support and installation teams in our company.

We had around 150 solution partners in Turkey and in some neighboring countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, Turkmenistan, Russia).

We had installed the software, barcode systems and hand terminals I developed for over 1500 businesses (factories, warehouses, stores, vehicle sales, etc.).
